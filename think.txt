For each build, we give them a token that is used to connect to the websocket.


There is also gloabl token that is used to connect to the websocket
to access all things logs of what project and which build is going on.


1. Two project cannot start at the same time,
2. Two build of a project cannot start at the same time,

A one sender for each build.

A one sender for whole project

. let say we have a project called "test"
and we are building something, 


if one build all things compete, socket will be closed,
sender should ne terminated for that bbuild,

if whole project is complte,gloabl sender will be closed,

This way the only two sender can be used for all the project.

Also the socket session will be stored
